INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create an example on jsbin by cloning this template: http://jsbin.com/panovu/edit
2. Make sure it's awesome, clean, and demonstrates only one thing
3. Create a PR to this file. Put it in the right category (or make a new one).
     The "slug" is the unique part of the jsbin url ("panovu" is the slug for the template)
4. Wait patiently while it's evaluated :-)
5. Cheer with us! Formly rocks! :-)
